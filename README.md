## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex. I live in France and I'm a marketing and localization specialist.

You can see more about me at my blog, https://alexsirac.com.

I'm not Â« a tech person Â», but I enjoy writing documentation, contributing to open source projects in non-codey ways, and am currently doing a beginner's course in computer science. (It's going great!)
